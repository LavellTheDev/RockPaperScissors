/* I want to create a game that plays rock paper scissors  */
// I need it so both players start off with an equal score
//Human user will need to click on one of three symbols
//Bots decisions will be determined at random
//The winner will be based off human and bot choice
//Once either human or bot wins the scoreboard needs to update

//* make game ridiculous
