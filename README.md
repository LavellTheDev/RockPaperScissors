# My Awesome Project
The goal was to create the most annoying rock paper scissors game possible. I wanted to provide it with a retro 80's look, sound and feel.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

HTML:
The setup for the HTML is pretty simple. I decided to go with camelCase since it is the method I feel most comfortable working in. Within the body I created a brief description with the purpose of being over the top. I used h1 for Rock, Paper & Scissors because to me that is the main point of this game. An H3 for Spock and Lizard due to the face that those are extra features. Added tables to hold the important stuff, used a few divs and used audio files within the HTML.

CSS:
Contains background image, a few borders and semi transparent backdrop colors. This was due to how hard it was for the typeface to be read.

JavaScript: 

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
